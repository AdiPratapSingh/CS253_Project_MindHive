## MindHive
MindHive is a portal where community members can help each other by clearing doubts that other members have asked. This is a user-friendly and easily accessible question-answer application that would save the time of the IITK junta. Basically, it is a QnA website for the IITK community. Users can ask questions and also post answers to the questions previously asked. There is also an option to give comments to questions and answers.
